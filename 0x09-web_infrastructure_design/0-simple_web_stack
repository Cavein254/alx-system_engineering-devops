A single server with a LAMP stack
Step-by-step explanation
1. Scenario: User visits www.foobar.com

A user opens a browser and types www.foobar.com:

    DNS resolution:

        The browser asks a DNS resolver for the IP address of www.foobar.com.

        Since the www record is a DNS A record, it resolves to the IP 8.8.8.8.

    Connection to the server:

        The browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server at 8.8.8.8 over the internet.

    Web server receives the request:

        Nginx listens on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).

        It passes dynamic requests to the application server.

    Application server runs the app:

        The app server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI, or PHP-FPM) executes your code base, handles logic, and queries the database if needed.

    Database query:

        The app server requests data from MySQL (e.g., product list, user profile).

    Response:

        The application server returns the generated HTML (or JSON) to Nginx, which sends it back to the user’s browser.

Key components & roles

    Server:
    A physical or virtual machine with an IP address that runs software (Nginx, app server, MySQL) to serve your website.

    Domain name (foobar.com):
    A human-readable address that maps to your server’s IP so users don’t have to remember 8.8.8.8.

    DNS record:
    The www in www.foobar.com is a subdomain, and here it’s set as an A record pointing to 8.8.8.8.

    Web server (Nginx):
    Accepts incoming HTTP requests, serves static files, and forwards dynamic ones to the application server.

    Application server:
    Executes the code base, processes logic, handles form submissions, and talks to the database.

    Application files (code base):
    The actual website code — could be PHP, Python, Node.js, etc.

    Database (MySQL):
    Stores data like user accounts, blog posts, products, etc., in a structured format.

    Communication:
    The server communicates with the user’s computer using HTTP or HTTPS over TCP/IP.

Issues with this setup

    Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

        If this one server goes down, the entire website is offline.

    Downtime during maintenance:

        Deploying new code, upgrading software, or restarting Nginx means users can’t access the site during that time.

    Scaling limitations:

        One server can only handle a limited amount of traffic.

        High load will slow down or crash the site, since there’s no load balancing or multiple servers.
